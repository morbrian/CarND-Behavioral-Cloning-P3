# Project-3: Behavioral Cloning

The third project in the first 3 month session of the Udacity Self Driving Car series.

## Backround

The first 3 month session of the Udacity program focuses on Deep Learning and Computer
Vision. This project in particular is focused on implementing a Deep Learning neural
network to teach an unmanned vehicle to stay on the road through behvioral cloning.

The term *behavioral cloning* describes a strategy by which a computer can learn to observe 
characteristics of a particular behavior and then mimic the behavior on its own. In this
project the observed behavior is simple instance of driving a vehicle on an empty road,
and the method of observation is via three front facing cameras mounted on the vehicle
to capture images of the road and landscape ahead.

Students are provided with a computer simulator in which they can manually drive a vehicle
around a track in a 3D graphics modeled landscape. Images are captured from the vehicle's
perspective, along with the steering angle recorded at the time the image was rendered.

The expectation is that students will be apple to use the recorded data in order to
train an algorithm to produce steering angles that will keep the car from veering
of the road.
